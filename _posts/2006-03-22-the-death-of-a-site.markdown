Hello all, I’m in the process of moving the hosing of my PearPC site away from my home computer. This should mean this page is now always accessible instead of only when I’m online.

Please note that the URL has changed and that http://pearpc.sytes.net has a 301 permanent redirect up (so anyone going there will be auto-magically sent here instead :-)

If either yourself or a site you visited is still linking to http://pearpc.sytes.net could you please change the link to point here.

I’m also trying to design some kind of nice looking site that I can use as a ‘real’ place on the internet rather than just some text and a few downloads. However, I’m really bad at designing things, so this might never happen, or it might just take some time.
