Well, I’ve added a bit of CSS to the site to try and style it. It shouldn’t be hard since it’s my job to build sites… I just can’t design them, that’s the problem.

I’ve also uploaded my age old webcomic called [CRBP](http://espadav8.co.uk/crbp/). It was done just to annoy a mate of mine at the time, and I’ve not updated it in a few years, and I don’t think I will be any time soon either. Probably for the better ;-)

I’m working on a little PHP thing as well. Nothing out of this would, but hopefully it’ll be fun. I don’t know much PHP though so it’s going to take some time. I’ll update you when things start to progress.
