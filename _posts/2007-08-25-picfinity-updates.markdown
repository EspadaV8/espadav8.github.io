Well, Iâ€™ve done a few more releases, latest is now [version 0.10](http://downloads.sourceforge.net/picfinity/picfinity-0.10.tar.bz2) which allows comments to be added to the images. My site always runs the latest version so feel free to test it out.

Planning on doing a few more versions to fix a few cross-browser issues, and then going to start working on some more colourful themes and also have a look at using the [jQuery](http://jquery.com/) framework.
