So, again, it’s been a while, but I’m still alive. Since the last update [Picfinity](http://sourceforge.net/projects/picfinity/) got updated to [version 0.11](http://sourceforge.net/forum/forum.php?forum_id=731538). This just added in more support for the other browsers. I have started work on a [jQuery](http://jquery.com/) theme, but I’m lacking in one of the most important skills, that of the designer. So at the moment it’s sat on my localhost and doesn’t look too much different from the old version, only in (nasty) greens and yellow-ie browns. It’s also not very [jQuery-y](http://jquery.com/) in that the only effects I’m using are fades and scrolls and the ‘popup’ box [Thickbox](http://jquery.com/demo/thickbox/) to show/resize the images. It would be nice to add sliders in to change the thumbnail size and do lots of fancy effects, but I need to brush up on how to do these, and how to use them so they don’t look nasty/tacky and just bad.

Also, I’ve now got a job, just working 15h part-time at [Sainsburys](http://sainsburys.co.uk/). Doing the 5am-10am fresh food shifts :S ~~Still, I’m sure I’ll be able to cope ;)~~

Other than that, I think life is ticking along as per usual. Driving is coming along nicely, although I’ve had to cancel my first lesson since it clashed with my [Sainsburys](http://sainsburys.co.uk/) training, but I’ll be able to catch up again. Money for now is still low, but when I start getting the overtime hopefully I’ll have a bit more money to start saving.

Until I next update, have fun.
