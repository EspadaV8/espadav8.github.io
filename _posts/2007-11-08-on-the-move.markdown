I was meant to be writing this on my new company phone, but alas I lost the connection and then lost what I wrote, so I'm just going to write it normally now.

I have a new job :–D It's with a company called [Palringo](http://www.palringo.com/). I've come onboard as "The New Web Guy". Enjoying it so far, which is always good :–)

That's all for now
