Google has the new-ish +1 buttons appearing up on sites that add a bit of code to their pages, however, the sites you visit might not have the button added just yet. A simple way to +1 these pages is to visit this pageâ€¦

http://www.google.com/webmasters/+1/button/

Click the 'Advanced options' and enter the URL of the page you want to +1. The preview button will update allowing you click it and have the page +1'd. If you have Google+ too, the new page will show up in the +1 tab and all is good :)
