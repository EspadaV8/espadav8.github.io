Early morning brain farts meant I wasn't able to work out how to detect which submit button was being pressed when a form was submitted. My Google-fu didn't turn up anything other than some poor looking JS solutions, turns out it's very easy.

```html
<button type="submit" name="action" value="approve">Approve</button>
<button type="submit" name="action" value="decline">Decline</button>
```

Really, just needs a name and a value like any other HTML element. For some reason I thought that just having the value would magically make it work and appear as the value for `submit`, but nope, not without the name attribute.
